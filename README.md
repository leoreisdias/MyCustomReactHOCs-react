# MyCustomReactHOCs

This repository contains custom Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for use in React applications. Feel free to copy and use these HOCs in your own projects.

## Summary

- [`withPermission`](https://github.com/leoreisdias/MyCustomReactHOCs-react/tree/main/withPermission): Adds display rules for a component based on the permission passed during its export.
- [`withLayout`](https://github.com/leoreisdias/MyCustomReactHOCs-react/tree/main/withLayout): Adds a layout to a page at the time of its export (useful for Next.js applications).
- [`withContext`](https://github.com/leoreisdias/MyCustomReactHOCs-react/tree/main/withContext): Adds context API around pages at the time of their export (very useful for Next.js applications).
